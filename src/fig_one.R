# ----- ABOUT THE SCRIPT -----

# Generates Figure 1 for AZNABA

# KATY NOTES:
  # Make black and white
  # Have 3 shapes for season sampled (Fall, Spring, Both)
    # Black circle, white circle, black and white circle
  # Data frame headers:
    # Site no. | Site name | Lat | Long | Elevation | Season | Years | Times

# Original figure is terrain map with different color for each site
  # and three different shapes (circle, square, triangle)




# ----- LOAD LIBRARIES -----
