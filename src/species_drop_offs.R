# ----- ABOUT -----

# Figure for Discussions

# Make list of all species in first five years of study time frame
  # Similarly, make list for last five years
  # Find which species are no longer in list during last five years
  # Which species drop off each year within those last five years




# ----- LOAD LIBRARIES -----
